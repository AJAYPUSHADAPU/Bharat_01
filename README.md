Unlike dense matrices, which store values for every element, sparse matrices contain mostly zero elements, making them efficient for representing large datasets or systems with many empty or insignificant entries.

Sparse matrices are used to efficiently represent and store matrices in which most of the elements are zero. This is significant in various fields such as scientific computing, engineering, and machine learn
